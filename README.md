# USB Device Monitoring and Management System

USB devices have become an integral part of modern computing, serving as essential tools for data transfer, peripherals, and mobile connectivity. However, these devices also pose significant security risks, as they can act as vectors for malicious software or unauthorized access to sensitive systems. Traditional security measures, which often rely on static rule-based configurations, struggle to adapt to the dynamic nature of USB-based threats.

This project introduces an intelligent USB Device Monitoring and Management System utilizing Ubuntu's capabilities and a Raspberry Pi configured as a USB gadget. This dual-component system offers real-time monitoring, integrates a semi-supervised learning model, and adapts based on user interactions and new device behaviors, providing robust and adaptive USB security management.

## Core Components
1. **Ubuntu USB Device Manager**: A dynamic monitoring and management system that detects, identifies, and controls USB devices on Ubuntu, learning from user input to automate future responses.
2. **Raspberry Pi USB Gadget**: Configured as a flexible USB gadget capable of simulating various device types, like USB mass-storage or Keyboard.
